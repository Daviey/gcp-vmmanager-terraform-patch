# GCP VM Manager Security and Automation

This repository contains security documentation and infrastructure-as-code examples for GCP VM Manager, focused on secure implementation while allowing controlled automation.

## Repository Contents

### Infrastructure as Code

- [Terraform VM Patch Module](terraform-vm-patch/) - Reusable Terraform module for managing VM Manager patch deployments
- [Example Implementation](terraform-example/) - Example of using the module across projects

## Security Approach

This repository attempts to follow a "secure by default" approach to VM Manager, addressing the core security concern: **VM Manager requires root access to function but should be carefully controlled to prevent privilege escalation.**

The key security principles implemented are:

1. **Least Privilege** - Strict IAM controls limit who can execute patch operations
2. **Standardized Templates** - Pre-approved configurations prevent arbitrary code execution
3. **Cross-Project Reusability** - Templates can be deployed across projects without modification
4. **Audit Logging** - All operations are logged for security monitoring

## Quick Start

### Deploying Patch Templates

Use the included Terraform module to deploy standardized patch templates:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/gcp-vmmanager-security

# Navigate to the example directory
cd gcp-vmmanager-security/terraform-example

# Configure variables for your environment
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
vi terraform.tfvars  # Edit with your project details

# Initialize and apply
terraform init
terraform apply
```

## Automated Patch Management Without Root Access

A key feature of this implementation is providing VM patch management capabilities to operations teams without giving them direct root access:

1. The Terraform configurations create standardized, pre-approved patching templates
2. Teams can deploy and schedule these templates without requiring elevated privileges
3. All executed code is pre-approved and version controlled
4. Patch operations run with elevated privileges but in a controlled manner
